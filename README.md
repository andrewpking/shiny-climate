## Introduction

Aggregating and comparing climate change data on carbon emissions and global temperature changes.

### Dataset

Two datasets were used, both of which can be found on Kaggle. One is CO2 Emissions over time by country, the other is Temperature data over time from Berkeley Earth. They can be found here:

* ["2022 Complete CO2 Emissions"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dustinober/2022-complete-co2-emissions?select=owid-co2-data.csv)
* ["Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
